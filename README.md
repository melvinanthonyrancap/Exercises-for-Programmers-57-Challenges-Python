# Exercises-for-Programmers-57-Challenges-Python
Solutions in Python 3.7.1 for the problems from the book " [Exercises for Programmers 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills](https://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Programmers-Challenges-Develop-Coding/dp/1680501224)" by Brian P. Hogan 


## Purpose / Motivation 
<p> Decided to share the solutions to these problems in Python 3 for anyone who is learning python for the first time because the problems in this book are good way to challenge you with the basics of any programming language. I didn't upload answers to 50-57 because I a had some issues gaining access for certain APIs and other things. Maybe later I will upload a solution to those. My solutions may not be the most optimal for time,space or readablity because I am currently learning Python.Also, I followed problem constraints in the book.</p>
