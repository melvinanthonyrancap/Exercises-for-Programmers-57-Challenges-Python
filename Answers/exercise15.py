Password Validation
Passwords are validated by comparing a user-provided
value with a known value that’s stored. Either it’s correct or
it’s not. Create a simple program that validates user login credentials.
The program must prompt the user for a username and
password. The program should compare the password given
by the user to a known password. If the password matches,
the program should display “Welcome!” If it doesn’t match,
the program should display “I don’t know you.”

Example Output
What is the password? 12345
I don't know you.
Or
What is the password? abc$123
Welcome!

Constraints
• Use an if/else statement for this problem.
• Make sure the program is case sensitive.
